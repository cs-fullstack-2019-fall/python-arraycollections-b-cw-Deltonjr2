# Problem 1:
#
# Create a function with the variable below. After you create the variable do the instructions below that.
#
# arrayForProblem2 = ["Kenn", "Kevin", "Erin", "Meka"]
# a) Print the 3rd element of the numberList.
#
#     b) Print the size of the array
#
# c) Delete the second element.
#
#     d) Print the 3rd element.
#
#     Problem 2:
#
# We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
#
# Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.
#
# Problem 3:
#
#     Create a function that contains a collection of information for the following. After you create the collection do the instructions below that.
#
# Jonathan/John
# Michael/Mike
# William/Bill
# Robert/Rob
# a) Print the collection
#
# b) Print William's nickname
#
# Problem 4:
#
#     Create an array of 5 numbers. Using a loop, print the elements in the array reverse order. Do not use a function
#
# Problem 5:
#
# Create a function that will have a hard coded array then ask the user for a number. Use the userInput to state how many numbers in an array are higher, lower, or equal to it.
#
# //1  Create a function with the variable below. After you create the variable do the instructions below that.
